# react-login-ready-empty-app
## Empty template projects for react and react-native
### The purpose: Ever get tired of having to re-implement standard boiler plate code for every project?
-  Login / Logout
-  Token JWT
-  Local Storage to keep logged in state or page reload for time expired tokens.
-  Axios Setup to utilize the logged in token aquired and a configurable header bearer token setup for HTTP/HTTPS rest api support against authenticated APIs.
** This Includes Adding APIs.  APIs that go against an App Key and domain etc. etc.  and the slices for Redux already thought out and ready to expand upon.
-  Reset Password, Email, Phone Support
-  Forgot Passowrd, Emial, Phone Support
-  2factor on/off
-  Create User (based on plugins).
-  Deactivate Account.
-  Router Latest from React setup Same for React-native. (Sense I have to do much of the same for mobile).
-  Redux and redux-toolkit all properly setup with login and all these states implemented.  So all you have to do is start coding against an API.
-  Popups and Layout already setup with Grid.
-  Social Media Login Plugin Support.  Default supplied: (Facebook, Google)
-  Security already setup and ready to go from a client stand point.
-  Third Party Phone/Email Validation Systems.  Plugin System 

#### So you'd take this project. For mobile or for a webapp.  Use this as a starting template.  Add your setup and there you go start coding pages.. No blank page... User login totally not setup all that stuff you have to do before you start coding your landing page.  Ready to go.. Turns out it's always a pain in the you know what.  So Get this ready to go.. Use it.. And start coding your app.  Feel free to use for your own purposes.

A nod out would not hurt.  This using the react-native and react create-app plugins to generate the app sturcture.  Utilizing TypeScript.
